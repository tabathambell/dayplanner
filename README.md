# Day Planner

## Description
This assignment was fairly straight forward in comparison to last week's assignment with the DOM. Boostrap and JQuery proved to be far more efficient ways of using Javascript and I thoroughly enjoyed this week's assignment. 

The code is laid out by several div's paired with text area tags that all align in one column with three rows. The first row is to signify what time it is, followed by the center row being the text box, then the third row being the save button. They are all tied together with standard CSS to make it look a little nicer.

The JQuery part of this assignment was only 31 lines of code instead of the 203 lines of code it was for the Code Quiz assignment, so it is far more readable and shorter than before. In this case, I used Moment.js to format the date so it changes from day to day, followed by using it to find what the exact hour it is, using the "this" code in order to differentiate between present, future, and past so that the appropriate colors are highlighted as the day goes on.

Further down the code, you end up seeing local storage where it saves by the hour that it is paired with after hitting the save button and producing the value that was originally produced inside of the text box. Following that, we were able to make the save button clickable using the "click" code in order to save the local storage in where it needs to be and remain visible even as you get out of the page.
